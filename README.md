# myCovidRecord Application
This is a CS106 Assessment-2 project by Gilberto Gabon and Trish Cribb-lankey.

This software system is a vaccine information system specifically for the coronavirus or more commonly known as COVID-19 virus. 

This system is designed to maximize the user’s as well as the vaccine information system administrator’s productivity by providing tools to assist in viewing COVID-19 records, including test and vaccine records and managing this information so it is current and readily available.

Specifically, this software application includes COVID-19 history records, test results, vaccine information, and digital vaccination certificates. This tool can generate a unique QR code that will display users' vaccination records for verification by other businesses. This application also allows users to download a COVID-19 vaccination certificate for use in New Zealand and overseas.
